Welcome!
Our group is formed by:
-Marc Roma Lara
-Marc Ramilo Garrido
-Bilal Boulouban Bargou

--------------------------------

In this project, our goal is to develop a corporate website using the version control system and a remote repository on GitHub.
Our website will be a restaurant site.
Every member of our group will be responsible for their own branch and files/pages.

At the beginning of every session, every member will PULL from the remote repository so that files are updated and ready to work. And at the end of every session, every member will PUSH their changes to the repository (if necessary) so everything is ready for the next session.

Finally, all the branches will merge back to the main one, making way for the final project which will be uploaded as instructed.
